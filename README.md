# Gatsby/Material UI Website
---
I’ve created a website about innovative bio-based materials. This was my first project using Gatsby, Material UI and Contentful CMS.
### What I learnt 
 I  created a custom MUI theme and explored various methods of styling Material UI components. While working on this project I also focused regular commits. If I were to recreate the project, I'd attemt to make the UI components even more granual to ensure even greater consitency and readibility of the code.
